# Projet-10-Reciplease

On this 10th project, I had to realize an application for gourmet

It offers a search recipe service by ingredients, and you save your favorite recipes.

This application is available on iPhone (from iOS 11.0) in portrait and is tested with unit tests.

By developing this project, I learnt about the use of Pods, networking request by alamofire and CoreDate.

To do this activity, I mainly got information from [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/4871481-faites-persister-vos-donnees-dans-votre-application-ios), Core Data by Tutorials, By the raywenderlich.com Tutorial Team, and I received advices from my mentor of OpenClassroom and also from my partner, who is himself an iOS developper.
